# Steering four-legged robot

This code is intended to work on Arduino and steer four legged robot of mine.

##  The plan

The more use cases done, the more roust and advanced the robot should be.

* [DONE] implement some static behaviours (like "bored robot")
* [DONE] use pre-computed inverse kinematics to implement balancing
* [TODO] use pre-computed inverse kinematics to mimic the movement in at least one direction
* [TODO] implement inverse kinematics
* [TODO] construct a controller-pad with bluetooth
* [TODO] add bluetooth to the robot and implement balancing
* [TODO] add bluetooth controlled movement
* [??] And figure out from there what is needed
